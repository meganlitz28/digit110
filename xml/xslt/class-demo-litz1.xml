    <lb num="8"/>Thy self thy foe, to thy sweet self too cruel:

    <lb num="1"/>Canst thou, O cruel! say I love thee not,
    <lb num="2"/>When I against myself with thee partake?
    <lb num="3"/>Do I not think on thee, when I forgot
    <lb num="4"/>Am of my self, all tyrant, for thy sake?
    <lb num="5"/>Who hateth thee that I do call my friend,
    <lb num="6"/>On whom frown'st thou that I do fawn upon,
    <lb num="7"/>Nay, if thou lour'st on me, do I not spend
    <lb num="8"/>Revenge upon myself with present moan?
    <lb num="9"/>What merit do I in my self respect,
    <lb num="10"/>That is so proud thy service to despise,
    <lb num="11"/>When all my best doth worship thy defect,
    <lb num="12"/>Commanded by the motion of thine eyes?
    <lb num="13"/>But, love, hate on, for now I know thy mind;
    <lb num="14"/>Those that can see thou lov'st, and I am blind.

  <poem type="sonnet" romNum="CL" num="1">
    <lb num="1"/>O! from what power hast thou this powerful might,
    <lb num="2"/>With insufficiency my heart to sway?
    <lb num="3"/>To make me give the lie to my true sight,
    <lb num="4"/>And swear that brightness doth not grace the day?
    <lb num="5"/>Whence hast thou this becoming of things ill,
    <lb num="6"/>That in the very refuse of thy deeds
    <lb num="7"/>There is such strength and warrantise of skill,
    <lb num="8"/>That, in my mind, thy worst all best exceeds?
    <lb num="9"/>Who taught thee how to make me love thee more,
    <lb num="10"/>The more I hear and see just cause of hate?
    <lb num="11"/>O! though I love what others do abhor,
    <lb num="12"/>With others thou shouldst not abhor my state:
    <lb num="13"/>If thy unworthiness rais'd love in me,
    <lb num="14"/>More worthy I to be belov'd of thee.

  <poem type="sonnet" romNum="CLI" num="1">
    <lb num="1"/>Love is too young to know what conscience is,
    <lb num="2"/>Yet who knows not conscience is born of love?
    <lb num="3"/>Then, gentle cheater, urge not my amiss,
    <lb num="4"/>Lest guilty of my faults thy sweet self prove:
    <lb num="5"/>For, thou betraying me, I do betray
    <lb num="6"/>My nobler part to my gross body's treason;
    <lb num="7"/>My soul doth tell my body that he may
    <lb num="8"/>Triumph in love; flesh stays no farther reason,
    <lb num="9"/>But rising at thy name doth point out thee,
    <lb num="10"/>As his triumphant prize. Proud of this pride,
    <lb num="11"/>He is contented thy poor drudge to be,
    <lb num="12"/>To stand in thy affairs, fall by thy side.
    <lb num="13"/>No want of conscience hold it that I call
    <lb num="14"/>Her 'love,' for whose dear love I rise and fall.

  <poem type="sonnet" romNum="CLII" num="1">
    <lb num="1"/>In loving thee thou know'st I am forsworn,
    <lb num="2"/>But thou art twice forsworn, to me love swearing;
    <lb num="3"/>In act thy bed-vow broke, and new faith torn,
    <lb num="4"/>In vowing new hate after new love bearing:
    <lb num="5"/>But why of two oaths' breach do I accuse thee,
    <lb num="6"/>When I break twenty? I am perjur'd most;
    <lb num="7"/>For all my vows are oaths but to misuse thee,
    <lb num="8"/>And all my honest faith in thee is lost:
    <lb num="9"/>For I have sworn deep oaths of thy deep kindness,
    <lb num="10"/>Oaths of thy love, thy truth, thy constancy;
    <lb num="11"/>And, to enlighten thee, gave eyes to blindness,
    <lb num="12"/>Or made them swear against the thing they see;
    <lb num="13"/>For I have sworn thee fair; more perjur'd I,
    <lb num="14"/>To swear against the truth so foul a lie!

  <poem type="sonnet" romNum="CLIII" num="1">
    <lb num="1"/>Cupid laid by his brand and fell asleep:
    <lb num="2"/>A maid of Dian's this advantage found,
    <lb num="3"/>And his love-kindling fire did quickly steep
    <lb num="4"/>In a cold valley-fountain of that ground;
    <lb num="5"/>Which borrow'd from this holy fire of Love,
    <lb num="6"/>A dateless lively heat, still to endure,
    <lb num="7"/>And grew a seeting bath, which yet men prove
    <lb num="8"/>Against strange maladies a sovereign cure.
    <lb num="9"/>But at my mistress' eye Love's brand new-fired,
    <lb num="10"/>The boy for trial needs would touch my breast;
    <lb num="11"/>I, sick withal, the help of bath desired,
    <lb num="12"/>And thither hied, a sad distemper'd guest,
    <lb num="13"/>But found no cure, the bath for my help lies
    <lb num="14"/>Where Cupid got new fire; my mistress' eyes.

  <poem type="sonnet" romNum="CLIV" num="1">
    <lb num="1"/>The little Love-god lying once asleep,
    <lb num="2"/>Laid by his side his heart-inflaming brand,
    <lb num="3"/>Whilst many nymphs that vow'd chaste life to keep
    <lb num="4"/>Came tripping by; but in her maiden hand
    <lb num="5"/>The fairest votary took up that fire
    <lb num="6"/>Which many legions of true hearts had warm'd;
    <lb num="7"/>And so the general of hot desire
    <lb num="8"/>Was, sleeping, by a virgin hand disarm'd.
    <lb num="9"/>This brand she quenched in a cool well by,
    <lb num="10"/>Which from Love's fire took heat perpetual,
    <lb num="11"/>Growing a bath and healthful remedy,
    <lb num="12"/>For men diseas'd; but I, my mistress' thrall,
    <lb num="13"/>Came there for cure and this by that I prove,
    <lb num="14"/>Love's fire heats water, water cools not love.
