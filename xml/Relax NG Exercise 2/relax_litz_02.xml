    <title>Shrewsbury Cakes: Original Recipe.</title>

    <desc intro="about">This recipe comes from MS Codex 625, a manuscript recipe book that belonged
        to a student <origin when="location_time">in a London cooking school in the early eighteenth
            century.</origin> The pastry school was owned by <owner person="creator">Edward
            Kidder</owner><teach when="time_place">who taught at a few locations in London between
            around 1720 and 1734.</teach> Blank books with printed title pages seem to have been
        used by students to write down recipes they learned. Kidder also published his recipes in
        the printed volume, Receipts for Pastry and Cookery, in <time created="recipe"
        >1720</time>.</desc>

    <step recipes="change">Our recipe (halved from the original)</step>

    
        <ing><butter num="0.5">1/2 lb. (2 sticks) butter, softened </butter><sugar num="0.5">1/2 lb.
                sugar</sugar>
            <mace num="0.25">1/4 tsp. mace</mace>
            <cinn num="0.5">1/2 tsp. cinnamon</cinn>
            <egg num="2">2 eggs</egg>
            <flour num="0.75">3/4 lb. flour</flour></ing>

    <step num="2"><item tool="handmixer">Using an electric mixer,</item> cream together the butter
        and sugar. Then add the eggs and mix at medium speed until the mixture looks curdled. Sift
        together dry ingredients and add at low speed until just combined. Scoop and roll the dough
        by hand into 1-tbsp. balls, then pat flat. [You could also refrigerate the dough until it’s
        firm enough to roll out on a flat surface and cut out into rounds.]</step>

    <step num="3">
        <step bake="temp">Bake at 350F</step> for 15-18 minutes (ours were about 1/3″ thick, so you
        could roll them thinner and have a slightly shorter cooking time). They’re done once they
        turn the slightest bit brown around the edges. <yielded type="amount">This halved recipe
            yielded about two dozen cookies.</yielded>

    <step num="4"><step type="opt">If you like snickerdoodles (and who doesn’t?), you’d like these.
            We added the cinnamon because we like it and couldn’t resist</step>, and we thought it
        rounded out the mace nicely. These are mild, fairly soft cookies that are great with tea. We
        rolled and patted the dough into individual cookies because it was too soft and stick to
        roll out, but a little bit more flour and a stint in the fridge might make the dough easier
        to work with a rolling pin.</step>
