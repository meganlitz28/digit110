    <ship>On Board La Touraine</ship>
    <date>June 30th, 1917.</date>
    <para num="1">Even now that we are out of sight of land, it seems impossible that I am actually
        off to <place>France</place> and, for the first time in my life, traveling alone. Everything
        has happened so quickly since the <thing>American Fund</thing> for <place>French</place>
        Wounded found an opening for me in <place type="city">Paris</place> that I suppose I am
        still somewhat dazed and bewildered. The fact that I don't know what it will all be like and
        that I can't look ahead makes it easier to be happy and live in the present. Of course I
        have had a bit of a taste in <place type="city">New York</place> of the work that the A. F.
        F. W. is doing but its Headquarters in <place type="city">Paris</place> will be different in
        some ways I fancy.</para>
    <para num="2">I can't get over how lucky I am to have this chance for I realize how few girls of
        my age are getting across, and I understood the grit and pluck which made you encourage me
        on my great adventure and send me along a path which has proved so dangerous of late.</para>
    <para num="3">As we drifted down the <place>river</place>, in the sunset glow with two absurd
        tugs puffing alongside, I know that many eyes were moist and that the same thought was in
        all our minds. How many of this ship's company will see that sky-line again! It was very
        quiet, no one spoke much, and, little by little, the glow faded from the sky and one star
        after another appeared. I knew that you would be looking at those same stars down in
        Lakewood and that your thoughts and prayers were the same that filled my heart at that
        moment. Somehow distance does not separate, after all.</para>
    <para num="4">We waited near the <item type="important">Statue of Liberty</item> until <time
            type="hour">midnight</time>—a rumor had it that a "personage" was to come on board. This
        individual was shrouded in mystery until we put to sea when it was given out that the party
        which had clambered aboard in the night was none other than the Italian Mission. Our spirits
        rose at once for, what with <name>Frank Sayre</name> on the boat and these distinguished
        Italian gentlemen, we shall doubtless be honored by a bigger convoy and so doubly safe.
        However, thus far we have but two destroyers following us. They can be seen distinctly
        outlined against the horizon, one on each side, and seem to be the same somber
            <color>gray</color> which all ships are affecting in this war. A sailor informed me this
            <time type="day">morning</time> that we weren't in much danger for the <time>first four
            or five days</time> but that after that I might see some excitement. Here's
        hoping!</para>
    <para num="5">I have a <adj>small</adj> inside <place type="location">cabin</place> and my
        room-mate is quite a character. She is a native of <place>Haiti</place>, voluble and very
        portly—has four large pieces of baggage in our tiny stateroom, wears a <item type="clothes"
            >costume</item> which resembles a Mother Hubbard and smokes countless thin
            <item>cigarettes</item> that smell like incense! When I appeared, there didn't seem to
        be much room for me but, as she says, luckily I am <adj>small</adj>, and I was soon tucked
        into the upper berth with my belongings! She really isn't bad and after looking me over
        carefully told me that she didn't think we would fight and from that time has beamed upon
        me! She is going over to join her <person>son</person> who has been fighting with the
            <place>French</place> since the beginning of the war but will never go back to the Front
        now, having lost some <item type="body">fingers</item> off each <item type="body"
            >hand</item>. She is so thankful, she says, that he hasn't lost more than his <item
            type="body">fingers</item>.</para>
