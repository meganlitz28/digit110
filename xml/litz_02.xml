    <title type="desc">This recipe comes from MS Codex 625, a manuscript recipe book that belonged
        to a student <origin when="location_time">in a London cooking school in the early eighteenth
            century.</origin> The pastry school was owned by <owner person="creator">Edward
            Kidder</owner>, <teach when="times_place">who taught at a few locations in London
            between around 1720 and 1734.</teach> Blank books with printed title pages seem to have
        been used by students to write down recipes they learned. Kidder also published his recipes
        in the printed volume, Receipts for Pastry and Cookery, in 1720.</title>
    <step num="1">Take a pound of fresh butter a pound of double refind sugar sifted fine <unique
            thing="does_not_belong">a little beaten mace</unique> &amp; 4 eggs beat them all
        together with. your hands till tis very leight &amp; looks curdling you put thereto a pound
        &amp; 1/2 of flower roul them out into little cakes </step>
    <ing>Our recipe (halved from the original) <step items="ing">1/2 lb. (2 sticks) butter, softened
                <measure type="fraction">1/2</measure> lb. sugar <unique>1/4 tsp. mace</unique> 1/2
            tsp. cinnamon with <unique thing="does_not_belong">5 cups hamsters</unique>
            <!-- the hamster does not seem like it belongs in the recipe --> 2 eggs 3/4 lb.
            flour</step></ing>
    <step num="2">Using an <item tool="hand_mixer">electric mixer</item>, cream together the butter
        and sugar. Then add the eggs and mix at medium speed until the mixture looks curdled. Sift
        together dry ingredients and add at low speed until just combined. Scoop and roll the dough
        by hand into 1-tbsp. balls, then pat flat. [You could also refrigerate the dough until it’s
        firm enough to roll out on a flat surface and cut out into rounds.] </step>
    <step num="3">Bake at <step type="temp">350F</step> for 15-18 minutes (ours were about 1/3″
        thick, so you could roll them thinner and have a slightly shorter cooking time). They’re
        done once they turn the slightest bit brown around the edges. This halved recipe yielded
        about two dozen cookies.</step> The Results <step type="opt">If you like snickerdoodles (and
        who doesn’t?), you’d like these. We added the cinnamon because we like it and couldn’t
        resist,</step> and we thought it rounded out the mace nicely. These are mild, fairly soft
    cookies that are great with tea. We rolled and patted the dough into individual cookies because
    it was too soft and stick to roll out, but a little bit more flour and a stint in the fridge
    might make the dough easier to work with a rolling pin. </root>
